## Team Questions

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
str(choco)
nrow(choco)

```

**Question 1:**
1,852 chocolate bars were rated.

```{r}
table(choco$Review.Date)
barplot(table(choco$Review.Date), main = 'Reports vs Year', xlab = "Year", ylab = 'Number Reports')
```

**Question 2:**
The number of ratings gradually increases per year up until 2015 and then in 2016-2017 it drops back down. Specifically in 2017 it drops back down to the same number of ratings it was in 2006.

```{r}
barplot(table(choco$Review.Date), xlab = 'Year', ylab ='number of ratings', main = 'Number of Ratings per year')


```
